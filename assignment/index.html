    <p>I'm assuming that I've considered the right amount of options the mostPets conditional since
      I've only ran into examples with "if, else if, and else" so far and these 2 numerical values
      can only be greater than, less than, or equal to each other. But the line about 
      "being sure to think through all scenarios" is making me second guess myself lol</p>
    <p>I originally had line 75 written as ' mostPets = pets; '
      but decided I should probably consider both variables if possible. I changed the line to
      ' mostPets = pets, friendsPets; ' and it didn't break the code when I tested it,
      including when I tried incrementing each variable before the conditionals. Not sure 
      if this was the correct way to write this line, or if I had it right the first time?</p>
